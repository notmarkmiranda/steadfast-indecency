# Prop bet pool

This is a passion project because I am passionate about not manually recreating, improving, or running a spreadsheet every year for super bowl props. There is a staging environment located [here](https://steadfast-indecency-staging-aa8e54097fde.herokuapp.com/).

Feature set for Most Viable Product is:
- A registered user can create a pool with questions and options
- An admin of a pool can invite people to participate in a single or multi-entry pool
- An admin can mark answers as correct that will trickle down to rank users by points and/or max possible points
- An admin can trigger a tiebreaker if necessary
- An admin can end/archive a pool

Iteration 1:
- A pool can be copied from the prior year, with the choice to invite the same people from the prior year
- Spiking on Paypal (or other payment service) that will automatically collect and distribute money

Iteration 2:
- A pool can be marked as a recurring pool that will automatically re-create itself every year
